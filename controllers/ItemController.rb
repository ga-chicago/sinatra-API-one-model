      # • pagination? 
      # • logic to figure out what happened? and if its what we want? liiike...
      #   • are you gonna send back an item?
      #   • just the one item or all the items?
      # do you need to be communicating with your FE Devs about this?
      # or if its for public consumption what do you need to be sure to explain in your API documentation
